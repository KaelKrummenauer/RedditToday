# RedditToday
RedditToday intends to search for top words on Reddit Posts as a mean to gauge Reddit user interests.

How to help:

-You can help by joining our Discord and contacting other members working on the script to ask or tell us how you can better the script.

-Adding more words that can be filtered through the stopWords.txt file.

I will be adding more to the README as the project goes on.
